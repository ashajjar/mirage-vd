# Screenshots Directory

This directory contains screenshots for the Virtual Monitor landing page. To add or update screenshots:

1. Save your screenshots in this directory with descriptive names:
   - `screenshot1.png` - Main application interface
   - `screenshot2.png` - Settings or configuration interface

2. Image requirements:
   - Format: PNG or JPG
   - Recommended resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
   - File size: Optimize images to be under 500KB each
   - Aspect ratio: 16:9 or 4:3 preferred

3. After adding new screenshots:
   - Optimize the images for web using tools like ImageOptim
   - Update the alt text in index.html if needed
   - Test the page to ensure images load correctly

Note: The landing page is designed to work with two screenshots by default. If you need to add more, update the screenshot-grid section in both index.html and styles.css.
